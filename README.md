Visualizing telemetry data between Max Verstappen and Danny Ricciardo at Monza

This Jupyter notebook visualizes and most importantly, analyzes the difference in telemetry data between Max Verstappen and Danny Ricciardo at Monza, Italy (2021). Danny Ric went on to win the race. The idea of this mini-project was to see if Max could have caught up to Danny Ric if he hadn't come together with his title-rival, Lewis Hamilton that caused them both to be classified as 'DNF'.
